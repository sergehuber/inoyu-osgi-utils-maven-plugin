# OSGi Bundle Analyzer Maven Plugin

The OSGi Bundle Analyzer Maven Plugin is a collection of utilities designed to help developers work with OSGi bundles in Maven projects. This plugin provides several goals to analyze and manage OSGi-related aspects of your project.

## Features

- Locate packages within project dependencies
- Analyze package usage in OSGi bundles
- View and validate OSGi bundle manifests

## Prerequisites

- Maven 3.3.9 or later
- Java 8 or later

## Usage

This plugin can be used directly from the command line. Some goals require a Maven project context, while others can be used both within a project and independently.

### Locate Packages

This goal must be run within a Maven project context:

```shell
mvn dev.inoyu:osgi-analyzer-maven-plugin:1.0-SNAPSHOT:locate-package -Dpackage=com.example.package1
```


This goal scans your project's dependencies and reports where the specified package is found.

**Sample Output:**

```
ðŸ“¦ Package found in Project classes
Dependency trail:
â”œâ”€ dev.inoyu:osgi-tools:1.0-SNAPSHOT
com/example/package1/Class1.class
com/example/package1/Class2.class
```


### Analyze Package Usage

This goal must also be run within a Maven project context:

```shell
mvn dev.inoyu:osgi-analyzer-maven-plugin:1.0-SNAPSHOT:find-package-usages -Dpackage=com.example.package
```


This goal examines your project and its dependencies to find where the specified packages are used.

**Sample Output:**

```
Searching for usages of package: com.example.package
ðŸ“¦ Usage found in Dependency: org.example:example-artifact:1.0: com/example/usage/Class1 uses com.example.package.Class2
Dependency trail:
â”œâ”€ org.example:example-artifact:1.0
```


### View Manifest

This goal can be used both within a Maven project context and independently:

1. Within a Maven project:

   ```shell
   mvn dev.inoyu:osgi-analyzer-maven-plugin:1.0-SNAPSHOT:view-manifest
   ```

   This will display the manifest of the project's main artifact.

2. For arbitrary JAR files (can be used anywhere):

   ```shell
   mvn dev.inoyu:osgi-analyzer-maven-plugin:1.0-SNAPSHOT:view-manifest -Djars=path/to/your/jar1.jar,path/to/your/jar2.jar
   ```

This goal displays the contents of the OSGi bundle manifest, including all headers and their values.

**Sample Output:**

```
Analyzing manifest of: path/to/your/jar1.jar
================================================================================
Bundle-Name: Example Bundle
Bundle-SymbolicName: com.example.bundle
Bundle-Version: 1.0.0
Export-Package: com.example.package;version="1.0.0"
Import-Package: org.osgi.framework;version="[1.3,2)"
================================================================================
```


## Parameters

The plugin supports the following parameters:

- `package`: The package name to search for or analyze (for `locate-package` and `find-package-usages` goals).
- `jars`: A comma-separated list of paths to JAR files to analyze (optional for `view-manifest` goal when used outside a project context).

## Examples

1. Locate a package in a Maven project:

   ```shell
   mvn dev.inoyu:osgi-analyzer-maven-plugin:1.0-SNAPSHOT:locate-package -Dpackage=org.osgi.framework
   ```

2. Analyze package usage in a Maven project:

   ```shell
   mvn dev.inoyu:osgi-analyzer-maven-plugin:1.0-SNAPSHOT:find-package-usages -Dpackage=com.example.api
   ```

3. View manifest of the current Maven project:

   ```shell
   mvn dev.inoyu:osgi-analyzer-maven-plugin:1.0-SNAPSHOT:view-manifest
   ```

4. View manifests of multiple JARs (can be used anywhere):

   ```shell
   mvn dev.inoyu:osgi-analyzer-maven-plugin:1.0-SNAPSHOT:view-manifest -Djars=/path/to/bundle1.jar,/path/to/bundle2.jar
   ```

## Notes

- The `locate-package` and `find-package-usages` goals require a Maven project context and analyze the project's dependencies.
- The `view-manifest` goal can be used both within a Maven project (without additional parameters) and independently to analyze arbitrary JAR files using the `-Djars` parameter.
